# **HBNB project**

## Introduction
This document outlines the design and structure of HBnB, a vacation rental platform. The purpose of this document is to provide a clear overview of the system architecture, including its key components, relationships, and functionalities.
HBnB is designed to facilitate short-term property rentals by connecting property owners with potential guests. The system allows users to list properties with a list of amenities, search for accommodations, leave reviews, and manage reservations efficiently.

## Scope

This document covers multiple aspects of HBnBâ€™s system design

High-Level Package Diagram:

Class Diagram: Represents the data model, relationships, and key operations for managing users, places, reviews, and amenities.

Sequence Diagrams for API: Illustrates the flow of requests and responses between system components, detailing key API interactions.

The diagram serves as a blueprint for the hbnb application, detailing the core classes, their attributes, methods, and interactions. It provides structure for managing users, places, reviews, and administrative functions.

Business Logic Layer provides a structured and scalable foundation for the hbnb application, ensuring efficient management of users, places, and reviews while maintaining security and user experience.
